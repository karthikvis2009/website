        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Flow and mixing analysis of a Kenics helical static mixer with 6 elements.</p>
        <p><strong>Reference Paper:</strong> <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237224585_Laminar_Flow_in_Static_Mixer_with_Helical_Elements">Laminar flow in static mixer with helical elements</a></p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Model</h3>
        <p>The model geometry consists of 6 helical mixing elements of length <i>0.03 m</i> each within a pipe of diameter <i>0.02 m</i> and height <i>0.24 m</i> <br>
        This means a clearance of <b>one element length</b> at the start and end of the flow. <br>
        Each mixing element has one twist of 180<sup>o</sup>.</p>

        <p>
        The model was created using FreeCAD and the patches were exported as <i>STL</i> files and kept in the <i>"./constant/triSurface" </i>folder
        </p>
        <hr>

        <h3>Meshing</h3>
        <p>Meshing was perfomed using snappyHexMesh in OpenFOAM. This meshing technique produces mostly hexahedral elements with optional refinement around specified surfaces.</p>
        <p>The geometry was exported in <i>STL</i> format. <br>
        Separate <i>STL</i> files were created for the inlet, outlet, walls and the entire volume.
        </p>
        <p>The resulting mesh had 5789599 points and 4453943 cells.</p>
        <p>The following patches were created : inlet, outlet & walls</p>

        <h3>Physics</h3>
        <p>
        The <i>incompressible</i> Navier-Stokes equations were solved in OpenFOAM for a <i>laminar</i> flow case since for the simulation, Re = 10.<br>
        The Mass conservation equation is given by <br>
        $$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial z} = 0$$
        <br>
        The steady-state Momentum conservation equations in x, y & z directions are <br>

        $$ x:   u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + v\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} + w\frac{\partial u}{\partial z} = -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial P}{\partial x} + \nu\left(\frac{\partial ^2 u}{\partial ^2 x} + \frac{\partial ^2 u}{\partial ^2 y} + \frac{\partial ^2 u}{\partial ^2 z} \right)$$
        <br>
        $$ y:   u\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} + v\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} + w\frac{\partial v}{\partial z} = -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial P}{\partial y} + \nu\left(\frac{\partial ^2 v}{\partial ^2 x} + \frac{\partial ^2 v}{\partial ^2 y} + \frac{\partial ^2 v}{\partial ^2 z} \right)$$
        <br>
        $$ z:   u\frac{\partial w}{\partial x} + v\frac{\partial w}{\partial y} + w\frac{\partial w}{\partial z} = -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial P}{\partial z} + \nu\left(\frac{\partial ^2 w}{\partial ^2 x} + \frac{\partial ^2 w}{\partial ^2 y} + \frac{\partial ^2 w}{\partial ^2 z} \right)$$
        
        </p>

        <h3>Simulation</h3>
        <p>The case was simulated using OpenFOAM.</p>
        <p>The inlet flow velocity was set to <i> 0.01 m/s </i> in the length direction (z) and the internal flow field was initialized with the same velocity </p>
        <br>
        <h4>Boundary Conditions</h4>
        <table border="1">
            <tr>
                <th>Parameter</th>
                <th>Inlet</th>
                <th>Outlet</th>
                <th>Walls</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>Velocity</b></td>
                <td>uniform (0 0 0.01)</td>
                <td>zeroGradient</td>
                <td>noSlip</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><b>Pressure</b></td>
                <td>zeroGradient</td>
                <td>uniform 0</td>
                <td>zeroGradient</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <br>
        <p>The <b>steady-state</b> simulation was run for 1000 iterations using the SIMPLE algorithm.</p>
        <p>The residual plot is shown below with final residuals being in the order of 10<sup>-8</sup> </p>
        <img src="../assets/kenics/residuals.png" alt="normalized residual plot" style="width:40%;padding:0;">
        <p>As it can be seen from the residual plot. Although the pressure residuals get reduced fast and stabilize quickly, the velocities oscillate between 1.0 to about 0.1 of the maximum values.</p>
        <p>After about 600 iterations, the velocity residuals oscillate about a lower mean value and the solution can be considered to be converged.</p>

        <hr>

        <h3>Validation</h3>
        <p>Results were validated against the aforementioned reference paper.</p>
        <p>The pressure drop across the static mixer was 14.5 Pa which is very similar compared to the reference pressure drop of 14.4 Pa</p>
        <p>This provides a good enough quantitative validation but some more qualitative flow characteristics are also compared with the reference.</p>
