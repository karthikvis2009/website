        <p><strong>Description:</strong> Flow and mixing analysis of a Kenics helical static mixer with 6 elements.</p>
        <p><strong>Reference Paper:</strong> <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237224585_Laminar_Flow_in_Static_Mixer_with_Helical_Elements">Laminar flow in static mixer with helical elements</a></p>

        <h3>Model</h3>
        <p>The model geometry consists of 6 helical mixing elements of length <i>0.03 m</i> each within a pipe of diameter <i>0.02 m</i> and height <i>0.24 m</i> <br>
        This means a clearance of <b>one element length</b> at the start and end of the flow. <br>
        Each mixing element has one twist of 180<sup>o</sup>.</p>

        <p>
        The model was created using FreeCAD and the top, front and side views are as shown below.
        </p>

        <h3>Meshing</h3>
        <p>Meshing was perfomed using snappyHexMesh in OpenFOAM. This meshing technique produces mostly hexahedral elements with optional refinement around specified surfaces.</p>
        <p>The geometry was exported in <i>STL</i> format. <br>
        Separate <i>STL</i> files were created for the inlet, outlet, walls and the entire volume.
        </p>

        <h3>Simulation</h3>
        <p>The case was simulated using OpenFOAM.</p>
        <p></p>

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>The pressure and velocity distributions around the airfoil were obtained.</p>

        <h3>Validation</h3>
        <p>Results were validated against experimental wind tunnel data.</p>
