        <h3>Model</h3>
        <p>The model consists of a rectangular domain of length 50m and height 40m.<br>
        <p>The z-direction (empty) width was taken to be 1m. </p>
        <br>
        The cylinder is at 20m from the inlet boundary and in the middle of bottom and top boundaries. <b>
        </p>
        <p> The kinematic viscosity <b>($\nu$)</b> was set to <b>0.01</b>.</p>
        <p> The reference density used for the force-coefficients calculations ($C_d$ & $C_l$) was 1.</p>

        <h3>Meshing</h3>
        <p> Meshing was done using Gmsh.<p>
        <p> The resulting mesh had 11308 points and 11064 prism cells. </p>
        <p> The mesh was refined near the cylinder surface to accurately capture the drag and lift effects at the cylinder wall. </p>
        <p> The mesh along with the patch names can be viewed in the figure below.</p>
        <img class="case-info-img" src="../assets/fpcLam/mesh.png" alt="normalized residual plot" style="width:50rem">
        <p> The generated mesh (with extension .msh) was used in OpenFOAM using the <b>gmshToFoam</b> utility and the patch types were changed in <i>./constant/polyMesh/boundary</i> file. </p>

        <h3>Physics</h3>
        <p>
        The <i>2D incompressible</i> Navier-Stokes equations were solved in OpenFOAM for a <i>laminar</i> flow case since for the simulation, Re = 100.<br>
        The Mass conservation equation is given by <br>
        $$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = 0$$
        <br>
        The transient 2D incompressible momentum conservation equations in x & y directions are <br>
        <div class="math-responsive">
        $$ x: \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + v\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial P}{\partial x} + \nu\left(\frac{\partial ^2 u}{\partial ^2 x} + \frac{\partial ^2 u}{\partial ^2 y} \right)$$
        <br>
        $$ y: \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + u\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} + v\frac{\partial v}{\partial y} = -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial P}{\partial y} + \nu\left(\frac{\partial ^2 v}{\partial ^2 x} + \frac{\partial ^2 v}{\partial ^2 y} \right)$$

        <h3>Simulation</h3>
        <p>The case was simulated using OpenFOAM.</p>
        <p>The inlet flow velocity was set to <i> 0.5 m/s </i> (corresponding to Re = 100) in the streamwise direction (x) and the internal flow field was initialized with the same velocity </p>

        <p>The <b>transient</b> simulation was run for 350 s with a $\Delta T$ of 0.0001 using the PIMPLE (PISO/SIMPLE) algorithm.</p>
        <p>The PISO algorithm with 3 Non-orthogonal correctors and 2 correctors was used.</p>

        <p> From the residual plot, it can be seen that the residuals start oscillating and the solution can be said to be sufficiently converged since the residuals don't decrease anymore</p>

        <h3>Validation</h3>
        <p>Results were validated against the aforementioned reference paper.</p>
        <p>Drag ($C_d$) and Lift ($C_l$) coefficients were monitored during the simulations as a measure for convergence.</p>
        <p>A plot of these coefficients for the simulation time is shown below.</p>
        <img class="case-info-img" src="../assets/fpcLam/coeffs.png" alt="normalized residual plot" style="width:50rem">
        <p> From the plot, it can be observed that the system exhibits a steady oscillating pattern after the initial unsteadiness from about 200s. </p>
        <p> Time range of <strong>250-350s</strong> was selected for computing the average values for the coefficients to validate against the reference. </p>
        <p> The mean drag coefficient ($\overline C_d$) was calculated for the above time range and the <strong>root mean squared </strong> value of the lift coefficient ($C_{l,rms}$) was also calculated and these values are given in the table below along with the reference values. </p>

        </table>
        <br>
        <p> From the above table, it can be inferred that the simulation is successfully validated and the <strong> von Karmann vortex street</strong> can be observed behind the cylinder. </p>
